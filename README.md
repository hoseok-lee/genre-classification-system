Given a 30-second audio clip, its [mel-frequency cepstrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) power spectrum is extracted and processed by a unified CNN-RNN (LSTM) framework. The machine learning model was trained on the [GTZAN dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/gtzan) for a final performance measurment of 77.83%.
